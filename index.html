            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
              We are a collective of eco fashion companies dedicated to
              sustainable practices and ethical production. We revolutionize the
              fashion industry by offering stylish and eco-friendly alternatives
              to conventional clothing.

        <h2>Why Eco Fashion?</h2>
        <section class="why-eco-fashion">
          <div class="container" id="story1">
            <h3>Biodegradable And Organic</h3>
            <p>
              Textile choices in the fashion industry significantly contribute
              to environmental pollution. Synthetic materials like nylon and
              polyester, which are
              <strong>cheap but nonbiodegradable</strong>, are particularly
              problematic. The manufacturing process of these fabrics emits
              pollutants into the atmosphere, and their disposal in landfills
              can contaminate groundwater for years. Overall, fashion ranks as
              the third largest polluting industry globally, emitting
              <strong>10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</strong>—more than
              shipping and aviation combined. Natural materials used in fast
              fashion, such as cotton, also harm the environment due to
              extensive pesticide use and the addition of artificial dyes.
              <br />
              <br />
              We were born as an environmentally friendly response to these
              unsound practices. Instead of manufacturing clothes from harmful
              materials. We makes use of eco friendly fibers, such as hemp,
              linen, and cotton that is grown organically. By coloring these
              fabrics with natural dyes made from plants and roots,
            </p>

          <div class="container" id="story2">
            <h3>Recycling</h3>
            <p>
              Eco fashion also utilizes old or discarded clothing and other
              recyclable materials to make new clothes and accessories, creating
              fashionable garments from items as diverse and unlikely as plastic
              bottles and bicycle tires. By recycling existing materials, the
              amount of waste that ends up in landfills is minimized and energy
              expenditure is reduced by cutting back on the amount of textiles
              shipped from abroad.

            <h3>Fair Labor</h3>
            <p>
              <strong
                >In addition to our commitment to addressing environmental
                issues in the fashion industry, we also prioritize fair labor
                practices.</strong
              >
              We understand the importance of treating workers ethically and
              providing them with safe working conditions. Unlike some other
              companies, we ensure that our manufacturing processes adhere to
              fair labor standards and that our workers are paid fair wages. We
              strive to create a transparent and responsible supply chain, where
              workers' rights are respected and upheld. By emphasizing fair
              labor practices, we differentiate ourselves from companies that
              may overlook or neglect the well-being of their workers in pursuit
              of profit.

        <h2>How We Achieve Sustainable Fashion</h2>
        <section class="why-eco-fashion">
          <div class="container" id="story1">
            <h3>What Is 'Truly' Sustainable Fashion</h3>
            <p>
              Consider a situation where workers are guaranteed decent working
              conditions and a fair wage. However, if plastics and other
              synthetic materials are used in the process, the brand cannot be
              considered sustainable. To guarantee environmental and social
              sustainability, the brand must adhere to as many guidelines as
              possible and understand sustainability holistically.

            <h3>The Issue Of GreenWashing</h3>
            <p>
              Greenwashing is a type of marketing spin. False marketing is
              utilized to convince the public that a brand’s products,
              objectives, and policies are environmentally friendly.
              Greenwashing in fashion happens through deceptive certifications.
              The goal of certifications is to increase consumer and retailer
              trust. However, it is frequently enough to make just one organic
              cotton t-shirt for a brand to acquire one of these certifications.
              We are aware of this greenwashing and are committed to practicing
              eco-fashion.
